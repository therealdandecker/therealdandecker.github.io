    <p>People often ask, how did you get into woring in data? The truth is I more or less showed up and started doing it.</p>
<p>I started out coaching collegiate swimming - if you&rsquo;ve ever been a coach or an athlete you know there is a fair bit of data.  Working with age group and collegiate swimmers I started as anyone does by working in Excel and was always looking for a better way to do different things.  I wrote my first SQL query accidentally (more or less) on a MySQL deployment for a blog (needed to remove a bunch of posts.)</p>
<p>I met my wife while coaching and eventually decided to leave coaching to pursue another career; I worked in sales for a while and quickly recognized that while things were OK sales was probably not the right fit for me (30 + cold calls a day can get extremly difficult to maintain productivity.)  I strongly recommend doing some type of cold calling to anyone early on in their career as it will force you to confront and overcome a lot of fears as well as pre-conceived notions about the sales process.</p>
<p>My wife and I were expecting our first child in 2017.  I had always had a passion and interest in technology and I maintaned a small portfolio of side projects until landing at an insurance company as a Data Analyst where I worked in the enterprise data space for the first time.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years and I am now a Business Intelligence Manager at Peckham Industries, a construction materials firm in New York where I have been able to work more heavily in cloud technologies and work closely with our finance group.  Oversight of my team includes our ERP, enterprise managerial reporting, and Tier 3 triage of various user systems issues for financial applications.</p>
