      <description>People often ask, how did you get into woring in data? The truth is I more or less showed up and started doing it.
I started out coaching collegiate swimming - if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been a coach or an athlete you know there is a fair bit of data. Working with age group and collegiate swimmers I started as anyone does by working in Excel and was always looking for a better way to do different things.</description>

      <description>US Covid-19 Tracking   When the pandemic first hit there was actually not as much data around tracking COVID-10 so early on I wrote a web-scraper to gather some information and track it. The scraper used Beautiful Soup to scrape HTML data from a web page and land it in SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)  MS SQL - Python - PYODBC Container   Periodically as a &amp;lsquo;data person&amp;rsquo; you need to build or re-create an environment to work with SQL and Python.</description>
